description: Isaac Flint, a greedy billionaire businessmen plots to extract oxygen
  from the air and then sell it back to people if they want to live. Through bribes,
  blackmail and threats, he forces a group of scientists to develop a means of extracting
  the oxygen and forces politicians to cooperate with his plan. Soon, surrounded by
  a private army of guards to prevent the outraged populace from stopping him, Flint
  has "cornered" the oxygen market, and people everywhere have no choice but to pay
  for the air they breathe--or see themselves and their families die for lack of oxygen.
  When Gabriel Armstrong, one of the scientists working for Flint, refuses to go along
  with the billionaire's mad plan, and is joined by Flint's strong-willed daughter,
  Catherine, the stage is set for a worldwide conflict that almost brings humankind
  face-to-face with its final doom.
